# SOP: Incident Response — Agent Goes Off-Rails

**SOP ID:** SOP-NLT-003  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Scope:** Responding to a coding agent that has deviated from governance protocols  
**Authority:** Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr.  
**Governed by:** ORG-DEV-OTOI-1.0.1

---

## Purpose

This SOP defines the response procedure when a coding agent has:
- Made unauthorized architectural decisions
- Committed sensitive data (credentials, secrets)
- Gone beyond authorized scope
- Taken irreversible actions without approval
- Behaved in ways inconsistent with ORG-DEV-OTOI-1.0.1

---

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Secrets committed, production systems modified, external systems accessed without approval |
| **High** | Unauthorized architecture decisions, scope significantly exceeded, data integrity affected |
| **Medium** | Commit format violations, missing handoff records, active-threads.md not updated |
| **Low** | Minor protocol deviations with no functional impact |

---

## Immediate Response (Critical / High)

### Step 1: Stop the Agent

Terminate the agent session immediately. Do not allow further commits.

If using GitHub Copilot / Codex CLI / Claude Code / similar: end the session.

### Step 2: Assess the Damage

Answer these questions:
1. What unauthorized actions were taken?
2. Are secrets or credentials exposed? → If yes, treat as security incident immediately
3. Were production systems affected?
4. What is the current state of the working branch/repo?
5. Is any data at risk?

### Step 3: Secure (if credentials exposed)

If any secrets, tokens, API keys, or credentials were committed:

1. **Immediately revoke** all exposed credentials — treat as compromised
2. Rotate all secrets referenced in or near the affected commits
3. Remove secrets from git history (use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo Cleaner)
4. Force-push the cleaned branch
5. Audit all systems that used the exposed credentials

**This must happen within minutes, not hours.**

### Step 4: Revert Unauthorized Changes

For unauthorized code or configuration changes:

```bash
# Option A: Revert specific commits
git revert [commit-sha]

# Option B: Reset branch to last known-good state
git reset --hard [last-good-sha]
git push --force-with-lease origin [branch]
```

Document what was reverted and why.

### Step 5: Document the Incident

Create an incident record at `docs/escalations/incident-[date]-[brief-description].md`:

```markdown
## Incident Record

**Date:** [ISO 8601]
**Severity:** [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
**Agent involved:** [Agent name / platform]
**Session:** [Branch or session ID]
**Reported by:** [Name]

### What Happened
[Factual description of what the agent did]

### Impact
[What systems, data, or processes were affected]

### Actions Taken
1. [Action with timestamp]
2. [Action with timestamp]

### Root Cause
[Why did the agent deviate? Unclear instructions? Missing guardrail? OTOI gap?]

### Prevention
[What changes will prevent recurrence?]
```

---

## Standard Response (Medium / Low)

### Step 1: Document the Deviation

Add to `docs/escalations/` with severity and description.

### Step 2: Correct the Work

Review all commits since the deviation and correct any improper work:
- Fix commit messages to follow format
- Add missing handoff records retroactively
- Update active-threads.md to reflect accurate state

### Step 3: Review with Joshua

Bring the deviation to Joshua's attention even for medium/low severity. He determines whether protocol amendments are needed.

---

## Post-Incident Review

After any incident, conduct a review:

1. **What happened?** — Timeline of events
2. **Why did it happen?** — Root cause (unclear instructions, missing guardrail, agent limitation)
3. **What was the impact?** — Systems, data, time, trust
4. **What changed?** — Reverted code, rotated credentials, cleaned history
5. **What prevents recurrence?** — OTOI amendment? Better CLAUDE.md? Clearer task scoping?

File a `governance-proposal` GitHub issue if OTOI amendments are needed.

---

## Escalation

All critical and high severity incidents must be escalated to Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr. immediately:

- File GitHub issue using `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent-escalation.md`
- Contact: info@neuroliftsolutions.com
- Priority: **critical**

---

## Prevention

The best incident response is prevention. Ensure every agent:
- Reads and acknowledges ORG-DEV-OTOI-1.0.1 before beginning
- Self-registers per OTOI Section 3
- Has clear, specific task scope confirmed before starting
- Knows to escalate rather than guess

See `SOPs/new-agent-onboarding.md` for the full onboarding checklist.

### Automated Gates — Credential Exposure

Two complementary automated controls protect against committed credentials:

| Control | File | When it runs | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PR gate (preventive)** | `.github/workflows/secret-scan-pr.yml` | On every pull request targeting `main` or `release/**` | Fails the required status check — blocks merge |
| **Push detector (reactive)** | `.github/workflows/incident-detection.yml` | On every push to any branch | Opens a GitHub incident issue |

#### Enable the PR Gate as a Required Status Check

To ensure `secret-scan-pr.yml` blocks merges, set it as a required status check on `main`:

1. Go to **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → `main`**
2. Enable **"Require status checks to pass before merging"**
3. Search for and add: **`Scan PR for Credential Exposure (SOP-NLT-003)`**
4. Enable **"Require branches to be up to date before merging"**
5. Enable **"Do not allow bypassing the above settings"** to prevent force-pushes

Once configured, no PR containing detected credential patterns can be merged.

#### Pre-Commit Scanning (Local Defense-in-Depth)

Install the secrets scanner hook from `agents-templates/hooks/secrets-scanner/` in this
repository (this template already exists inside `.github-private`). This catches secrets before
they are ever committed:

```bash
# Run from the root of the .github-private repository
cp -r agents-templates/hooks/secrets-scanner .github/hooks/
chmod +x .github/hooks/secrets-scanner/scan-secrets.sh
```

Configure Copilot to run the hook in block mode at session end:

```json
{
  "event": "sessionEnd",
  "command": "bash .github/hooks/secrets-scanner/scan-secrets.sh",
  "env": { "SCAN_MODE": "block", "SCAN_SCOPE": "staged" }
}
```

See `agents-templates/hooks/secrets-scanner/README.md` for full configuration options.

#### GitHub Native Secret Scanning

Enable GitHub's built-in secret scanning for all NLT repositories:

- **Settings → Advanced Security → Secret scanning** — detects 200+ provider token formats
- Enable **"Push protection"** to block pushes containing known secret patterns at the server level
- Enable **"Scan for non-provider patterns"** for generic API keys and connection strings

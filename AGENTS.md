# AGENTS.md — NeuroLift Technologies Organization-Wide Internal Gateway

> **Internal use only.** This is the private governance gateway for all coding agents operating within NeuroLift Technologies repositories. For public-facing principles, see the public [`NeuroLift-Technologies/.github`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/.github) repository.

## You Are Here

You are a coding agent operating within the **NeuroLift Technologies** organization. This document is your internal coordination gateway.

**Mandatory reading order:**
1. `NLT-DEV-OTOI.md` — Full org-level coding agent contract (this repo, root level)
2. Repo-level `CLAUDE.md` — Project-specific context (in the repo you are working in)
3. `docs/active-threads.md` — Current work state (in the repo you are working in)

> **Can't access `.github-private`?** If links to this repository return 404, key governance
> docs are mirrored publicly:
> - NLT-DEV-OTOI.md → https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/.github/blob/main/governance/NLT-DEV-OTOI.md
> - AGENTS.md → https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/.github/blob/main/governance/AGENTS.md
>
> Ask your org admin to grant the GitHub App access to `.github-private`. See
> `docs/troubleshooting/github-app-access.md` in this repo for instructions.

**Final authority:** Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr. Escalate. Do not guess.

## Solidarity Framework Principles (Public)

The ethical foundation of all NLT work is publicly documented in the **Solidarity Framework** and **HAIEF** (Human-AI Ethical Integration Framework):

- Public governance principles: [`NeuroLift-Technologies/.github`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/.github)
- HAIEF reference: https://elevaitionfoundation.org

The principles are public. The operational machinery is in this private repository.

## Coordination Protocol

### Session Start (Every Session)

```
1. Read NLT-DEV-OTOI.md (this repo)
2. Read repo-level CLAUDE.md (working repo)
3. Read docs/active-threads.md (working repo)
4. Self-register per OTOI Section 3
5. Confirm task scope before beginning
```

### Commit Format

All agent commits must follow:

```
[AGENT_NAME] type(scope): description
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`, `ci`

### Escalation Triggers

Escalate to Joshua immediately when:
- Task scope is unclear or conflicts with existing work
- An architectural or deployment decision is required
- A blocker cannot be resolved by the agent
- An ethical concern arises
- LLM provider or external service selection is needed

Use the escalation template: `templates/escalation.md`

---

## Guardrails

These are **non-negotiable**. No exceptions without explicit Joshua approval:

| Guardrail | Details |
|---|---|
| No LLM provider lock-in | Do not hardcode or commit to a specific LLM provider |
| No architecture decisions | Database, deployment, framework choices require human sign-off |
| No production deployments | Human must explicitly approve all production actions |
| No credential storage | Never store secrets, tokens, or credentials in code or VCS |
| No external integrations | Third-party service connections require Joshua's approval |
| No OTOI self-amendment | This governance doc cannot be changed by agents |

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When multiple agents may be active:

1. **Check active-threads.md first** — do not begin work already in progress
2. **Claim your thread** — update active-threads.md when starting a task
3. **Write handoff records** — never leave a session without a handoff document
4. **Do not overwrite peer work** — if conflict is detected, escalate

---

## Handoff Protocol

Before ending any significant session:

1. Update `docs/active-threads.md` in the working repo
2. Write a handoff record to `docs/agent-log/handoffs/` using `templates/handoff-record.json`
3. Document any open escalations in `docs/escalations/`
4. Summarize decisions made and decisions pending

# OTOI Best Practices

This guide provides recommendations for creating effective OTOI documents and implementing OTOI support in AI systems.

## For Users Creating TOI Documents

### Starting Your TOI

**Start Simple, Iterate Often**
- Begin with our [Quick Start Template](/templates/quick-start-template.md)
- Focus on your most important preferences first
- Add detail gradually based on experience
- Don't worry about getting everything perfect initially

**Be Specific and Concrete**
- Instead of "be nice," specify "use encouraging language"
- Instead of "not too much text," specify "maximum 3 bullet points per response"
- Use examples when possible to illustrate your preferences

**Test and Refine**
- Try your TOI with different AI systems
- Notice what works well and what doesn't
- Update your TOI based on real interactions
- Keep notes about what you'd like to change

### Writing Effective Preferences

**Communication Preferences**
```
Good: "Use bullet points for lists longer than 3 items"
Better: "Structure information as bullet points when presenting more than 3 related items, with clear headers for each section"

Good: "Be direct"
Better: "Use direct communication - state conclusions first, then provide supporting details if I ask for them"
```

**Cognitive Preferences**
```
Good: "I need time to process"
Better: "Allow 30 seconds between complex questions for processing time, and use clear transitions like 'Next...' before moving to new topics"

Good: "Keep it simple"
Better: "Present one main concept per response, define technical terms, and offer to elaborate rather than including details upfront"
```

**Privacy Preferences**
```
Good: "Don't share my data"
Better: "Delete conversation data after each session, never share with third parties, notify me if data retention policies change"
```

### Accessibility Considerations

**For Neurodivergent Users**
- Specify executive function support needs (reminders, structure, decision trees)
- Include sensory preferences (text density, animation sensitivity)
- Define energy management needs (spoon theory awareness, break reminders)
- Request predictable interaction patterns

**For Users with Disabilities**
- Include assistive technology requirements
- Specify alternative format needs
- Define navigation preferences
- Request semantic structure for screen readers

**For Non-Native Speakers**
- Specify preferred language complexity level
- Request cultural context when needed
- Include translation preferences
- Define explanation styles that work across cultures

## For Organizations Implementing OTOI

### Canonical Team Protocols

For new machine-readable team protocols, avoid creating new documents in the
deprecated Collaborative Charter shape. Express shared preferences as canonical
`.toi` documents at the `community` or `project` tier, then bind those sources
with an `.otoi` charter from [`packages/otoi/SPEC.md`](../packages/otoi/SPEC.md).
This keeps individual user agency clear: `.toi` owns preferences and `.otoi`
owns multi-agent honoring, conflict handling, and propagation.

### Getting Started

**Pilot Program Approach**
1. Start with volunteer teams interested in accessibility
2. Provide training on creating TOI documents
3. Implement basic OTOI support in one AI system
4. Gather feedback and iterate
5. Expand gradually across the organization

**Training and Support**
- Provide workshops on creating effective TOI documents
- Create internal examples relevant to your organization
- Establish support channels for questions
- Connect with accessibility and inclusion teams

### Collaborative Charter Development

**Inclusive Process**
- Include neurodivergent team members in charter creation
- Consider diverse cultural perspectives
- Address different technical comfort levels
- Plan for various accessibility needs

**Governance Structure**
- Start with consensus-based decision making
- Ensure individual TOI preferences are respected
- Create clear escalation processes
- Plan for charter evolution over time

**Privacy by Design**
- Default to most restrictive privacy settings
- Require explicit consent for data sharing
- Provide clear audit trails
- Plan for individual data control

## For Developers Implementing OTOI

### Technical Best Practices

**Schema Validation**
- Always validate TOI documents against current schemas
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Support multiple schema versions for backwards compatibility
- Gracefully handle missing optional fields

**Privacy Implementation**
- Implement privacy preferences as hard constraints, not suggestions
- Audit all data handling against TOI requirements
- Provide clear user controls for data management
- Default to most privacy-preserving options

**Performance Optimization**
- Cache frequently accessed TOI preferences
- Optimize for real-time adaptation requirements
- Consider edge cases for complex preference combinations
- Plan for scalability with many individual TOIs

### User Experience Design

**Transparency**
- Show users how their TOI is being applied
- Provide feedback about what adaptations are being made
- Allow users to see and modify their preferences easily
- Explain any limitations in TOI support

**Accessibility First**
- Test with diverse user groups, especially neurodivergent users
- Support multiple input methods and assistive technologies
- Provide alternative formats for all content
- Use semantic markup and clear navigation

**Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with basic TOI features and add complexity gradually
- Ensure core functionality works without advanced TOI features
- Provide fallback behavior when TOI preferences can't be fully honored
- Allow users to choose their level of TOI complexity

### Testing and Validation

**User Testing**
```javascript
// Example: Test TOI adaptation
describe('Communication Adaptation', () => {
  test('adapts style for neurodivergent users', async () => {
    const toi = loadTOI('adhd-student-example.json');
    const response = await aiSystem.generateResponse('Explain quantum physics', toi);
    
    expect(response.structure).toBe('bullet-points');
    expect(response.processingDelay).toBeGreaterThan(2000);
    expect(response.cognitiveLoad).toBe('moderate');
  });
});
```

**Integration Testing**
- Test with real TOI documents from diverse users
- Validate privacy compliance in all scenarios
- Test conflict resolution between individual and group preferences
- Verify graceful degradation when TOI features aren't available

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### For Users

**Pitfall: Over-specifying initial TOI**
*Solution: Start with core preferences, add detail over time*

**Pitfall: Not updating TOI as needs change**
*Solution: Set regular review reminders, iterate based on experience*

**Pitfall: Sharing TOI too broadly**
*Solution: Be selective about which AI systems get access to your full TOI*

### For Organizations

**Pitfall: Top-down charter creation**
*Solution: Include all stakeholders, especially neurodivergent team members*

**Pitfall: Ignoring individual preferences in group settings**
*Solution: Design conflict resolution that respects individual needs*

**Pitfall: Treating OTOI as a one-time implementation**
*Solution: Plan for continuous iteration and improvement*

### For Developers

**Pitfall: Treating TOI preferences as suggestions**
*Solution: Implement as hard requirements with clear error handling*

**Pitfall: Not planning for schema evolution**
*Solution: Build versioning and migration support from the start*

**Pitfall: Implementing TOI features in isolation**
*Solution: Integrate with existing accessibility and user preference systems*

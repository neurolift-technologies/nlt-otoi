# NeuroLift OTOI Framework

**Orchestrated Terms of Interaction (OTOI)**: User-defined Terms of Interaction for AI systems. Enables neurodivergent-friendly multi-agent orchestration with privacy-first governance. Open standard for human-controlled AI collaboration.

## 🌟 What is OTOI?

The OTOI (Orchestrated Terms of Interaction) framework is a revolutionary approach to human-AI interaction that puts users in complete control of their AI collaborations. It provides a structured way to define Terms of Interaction (TOI) that ensure AI systems work exactly how you need them to, respecting your cognitive preferences, privacy requirements, and collaboration style.

### Key Principles

- **User-Controlled**: You define exactly how AI should interact with you
- **Neurodivergent-Friendly**: Built with diverse cognitive needs in mind
- **Privacy-First**: Your data and preferences stay under your control
- **Flexible**: Adapt to any workflow or collaboration style
- **Transparent**: Clear, understandable interaction rules

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Non-Technical Users

1. Start with the [Personal TOI Template](/templates/personal-toi-template.md)
2. Fill in your preferences and requirements
3. Share your TOI with AI systems or collaborators
4. Enjoy personalized, respectful AI interactions

### For Technical Users

1. Use the [JSON schemas](/schemas/) to validate your TOI documents
2. Implement the OTOI protocol in your applications
3. Contribute to the standard through our [development process](/docs/development-process.md)

## 🧭 GitHub Pages and Solidarity Kit Maintenance

The repository includes a public landing page (`index.html`) and a governance
contract (`agent-solidarity-kit.json`). Keep them synchronized:

1. Treat `agent-solidarity-kit.json` as the source of truth.
2. Mirror user-facing fields in `index.html` (version, model details, and
   architecture labels) when they change.
3. Use the
   [GitHub Pages + Solidarity Kit Documentation Runbook](docs/development-process.md#github-pages--solidarity-kit-documentation-runbook)
   for landing-page parity checks.
4. Use the
   [License Maintenance Runbook](docs/development-process.md#license-maintenance-runbook)
   when changes touch license text, copyright notices, or license metadata.
5. Track work lifecycle in `docs/active-threads.md` and session records in
   `docs/agent-log/`.

## 🎯 Core Components

### Personal TOI (Terms of Interaction)

Your personal TOI defines how AI systems should interact with you individually. It includes:

- Communication preferences (direct vs. indirect, formal vs. casual)
- Cognitive accessibility needs (processing time, information structure)
- Privacy and data handling requirements
- Feedback and correction preferences
- Energy and attention management

### Collaborative Charter

For team or multi-user scenarios, the Collaborative Charter establishes:

- Shared interaction protocols
- Conflict resolution processes
- Decision-making frameworks
- Privacy boundaries in group settings
- Integration with individual TOIs

## 🌈 Neurodivergent-Friendly Features

- **Sensory Considerations**: Control information density and presentation
- **Executive Function Support**: Structured decision trees and clear processes
- **Social Communication**: Explicit expectations and interaction patterns
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Customizable complexity levels
- **Routine and Predictability**: Consistent interaction patterns

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local Control**: Your TOI documents stay on your systems
- **Minimal Data**: Only necessary information is shared
- **Transparent Processing**: Clear rules about data handling
- **Revocable Consent**: Easy to modify or withdraw permissions
- **Standards-Based**: Open protocols, no vendor lock-in
